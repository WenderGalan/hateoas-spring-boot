# Person API Project
### Implementation of a RESTFUL API

This API is designed for study using various tools and dependencies to enhance my knowledge of the dependencies below.

To run the project you need to define the profile you will use to start the application, or just run the application with docker-compose.

### Dependencies:
  - #### [MAPSTRUCT](https://mapstruct.org/): Used to quickly create new DTOS.
  - #### [LOMBOK](https://projectlombok.org/): Used to prevent use of getters, setters, equals, and other standard methods on persistence entities.
  - #### SPRING SECURITY
  - #### JPA
  - #### SWAGGER UI: Used for RESTFULL API Documentation
  - #### H2: Database for application
  - #### [HATEOAS](https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas)
  - #### [JUNIT](https://junit.org/junit5/)
